summary: |
  
  Currently pursuing an M.S. in Computer Science and applying AI-assisted workflows to real projects.

  Across projects, I've used Claude Code, Cursor with ChatGPT-5, and DALL·E 3 to deliver scalable, maintainable solutions—from transforming a 6,000+ line UI into a clean React design system, to building an end-to-end image-to-DXF pipeline for 3D-printed phone cases, to shipping a weather dashboard with clean server/client separation.
